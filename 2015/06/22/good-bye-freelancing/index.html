<section class='post-content'><p>It&rsquo;s been now 3 months that I have been officialy hired, 3 months that I&rsquo;m not a freelancer no more.
In a way, it&rsquo;s kinda funny that the exact same things that really thrilled me, are also those
that just bored me, at the same time. First of all was project switching. I&rsquo;m talking about working for bigger
companies using legacy PHP code one month, and a few days later for startups using cutting edge technologies. Within 6 years I designed and built brand new pretty apps from scratch and been dropped in the middle of some systems I would have never built this way if I could, and had no choice but to deal with it. I did some server administration stuff, testing, HTML/CSS integration, Javascript, Angular, Rails. I worked with CMS like Wordpress, Joomla, E-Commerce with Prestashop&hellip; and finally ended up completely exhausted.</p>

<p>In the end, I really think that if you want to enjoy freelancing, not only you don&rsquo;t have to be an expert, but
you <em>must not</em> be an expert, in anything. It&rsquo;s actually obvious: the more things you can do (I said &ldquo;do&rdquo;, not masterize), the more likely you&rsquo;ll get a chance to meet some client that may pay you to get these things done.
Like it or not, it&rsquo;s just the way it is. I&rsquo;m quite fed up about not being an expert in anything now, I want
to really dig into problems and technologies that I like the most.</p>

<p>One more thing that was getting more and more difficult to bear was loneliness, too. I need a buddy to say me things like &ldquo;dude, you&rsquo;re gonna be in serious trouble if you do it this way&rdquo;, or &ldquo;hey! Well done, this polymorphic tree was a neat idea&rdquo;. Ho, sure, there&rsquo;s always the (priceless) client feedback, but you can&rsquo;t compare any client to a colleague. And when you&rsquo;re stuck in the middle of a hairy problem, that&rsquo;s simply not the client&rsquo;s problem, that&rsquo;s your very own problem.</p>

<p>This end is a happy end, though, because I&rsquo;m hired by one of my oldest client that got bigger and bigger, years after years. It&rsquo;s just that we&rsquo;re now on the same boat.</p>

<p>I learned <em>tons</em> of thing as a freelancer, far behind just the technical stuff (human relationships, business&hellip;) now it&rsquo;s time to head in a more consistent and unique direction.</p>

<p>Good bye Freelancing. It&rsquo;s been a real pleasure. Who knows, maybe we&rsquo;ll meet again soon or later. But for now: Good bye.</p>
