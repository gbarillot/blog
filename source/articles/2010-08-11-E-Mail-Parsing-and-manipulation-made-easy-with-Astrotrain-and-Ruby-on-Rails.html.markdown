Currently working on a CRM project using Fat Free CRM, I needed to handle incoming mails into the machinery. But scanning mails, parse and extract them into plain HTML could really be a pain (I already
[talked about it](http://www.guillaume-barillot.com/blog/fr/2009/11/02/123-a-ruby-gateway-for-postfix-in-order-to-build-a-rails-webmail)...), until I discover
[Astrotrain](http://github.com/entp/astrotrain) ! God damn, another one Rails beautiful Gem/Plugin that just... works !

I love Rails ! (hu ? Did I ever said it yet ?!)
